üßë‚Äçüíª Code Examples
1. Conditionals-Statements
java
Copy
// Example of if-else statement
public class IfElseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is not positive.");
        }
    }
}
2. Datatypes
java
Copy
// Example of different data types in Java
public class DataTypesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int integerVar = 10;
        double doubleVar = 10.5;
        char charVar = 'A';
        boolean booleanVar = true;

        System.out.println("Integer: " + integerVar);
        System.out.println("Double: " + doubleVar);
        System.out.println("Char: " + charVar);
        System.out.println("Boolean: " + booleanVar);
    }
}
3. HelloWorld
java
Copy

        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
4. Input-Output
java
Copy
// Example of input and output operations
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputOutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
